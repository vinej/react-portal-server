## Goal

A REST server with Node.js and Express to use with 'reactboard'
build with the help of Stephen Grider course "Advanced React with Redux" (excellent)

For now the server is dealing with the authentification as describe by Stephen Grider
and returns a list of hardcoded users to test the 'users' widget' of the 'reactboard'. 

See : 'reactboard' for more information
