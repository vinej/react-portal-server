# react-portal-server

## Installation
* install 'nodejs'

## Goal

A REST server built with NodeJS and Express to use with the 'react-portal'. 
The online course "Advanced React with Redux" from Stephen Grider helped me a lot to do the server. The course is excellent.

For now the server is dealing with the authentification as describe by Stephen Grider
and returns a list of hardcoded users to test the 'users' widget' of the 'react-portal'. 

See : 'react-portal' for more information
