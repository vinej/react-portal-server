## Goal

A REST server with Node.js and Express to use with 'react-portal'
build with the help of Stephen Grider course "Advanced React with Redux" (excellent)

For now the server is dealing with the authentification as describe by Stephen Grider
and returns a list of hardcoded users to test the 'users' widget' of the 'react-portal'.
